Dear reader,
this is the repository of the documentation of a project of mine with which I attend at this year's "Jugend Forscht" competition. The details of the project are described in "rgbulb.pdf", the whole source is licensed under cc-by-sa, so feel free to remix respectively share it. An english translation will probably follow in the next weeks.
